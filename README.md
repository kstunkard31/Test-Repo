# Plot Pal
Data from biological studies can be exceedingly complex and require grouping and filtering versatility.

The idea behind PlotPal is to provide this versatility in a way that allows it to be customizable to the dataset uploaded by the user.

The user is not required to use the Grouping and Filter functions, but they are available if the data visualization requires them. 

See PlotPal Presentation for more details on how to use the app!
